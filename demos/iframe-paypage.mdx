# Iframe Paypage

The **Iframe Payment Page** is a secure checkout interface hosted by **PayBy**, designed to be embedded directly into your website. While the payment is processed on PayBy’s secure servers, the transition is seamless and invisible to the cardholder, ensuring a smooth user experience.
