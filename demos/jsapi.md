# JSAPI

The **JSAPI** feature allows merchants to invoke the **built-in checkout** of **BOTIM** and **PayBy** directly from a mobile website. When a customer opens the merchant’s webpage via a message in the BOTIM app, the checkout process is triggered seamlessly, enabling quick and secure payment.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Scan the QR Code**  
   Use the **PayBy app (test environment)** to scan the code above.  
   Find the APK and test account details [here](/demos/testaccount).

2. **Complete the Payment**  
   You’ll be redirected to the built-in checkout screen. Enter your password to finalize the transaction.

> **Note:** *If your customer opens your website within the BOTIM app, the same built-in checkout flow will be triggered automatically.*
