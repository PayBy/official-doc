# Chargeback Notification

## Overview

In the event of a chargeback, PayBy sends the relevant chargeback information to the merchant via a data stream. The merchant must process the notification and respond according to the specifications outlined in this document.

> **Note:**

> 1. The same notification may be sent multiple times. Merchant systems must be able to handle duplicate notifications correctly.
> 2. If PayBy does not receive a valid response from the merchant or if the response times out, the notification is considered failed and will be retried. The default retry schedule is as follows (in minutes): 2, 10, 10, 60, 120, 360, 900. However, PayBy does not guarantee final delivery.
> 3. If the order status is unclear or the merchant has not received a payment result notification from PayBy, it is recommended to actively query the order status using the appropriate API.
