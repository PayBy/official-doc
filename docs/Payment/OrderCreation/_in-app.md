  When a value is passed, it indicates that the merchant requires the user's Emirates ID to be verified. PayBy will perform the verification; if the ID matches, the process will proceed. If it does not match, an error will be returned to the user. If no value is passed, PayBy will skip this verification step. The parameter needs to be encrypted with SHA-256 when passed.
