# Asynchronous Notification

## Overview

When a merchant payment to a bank card has a result, PayBy sends the related result to the merchant. 

The merchant needs to receive and process the notification, then return a response. 
The actual arrival time depends on the settlement time of each bank and is subject to the actual arrival time.


### Notification Handling Guidelines

1. **Duplicate Notifications**  
   PayBy may send the same notification multiple times. The merchant system must be capable of identifying and handling duplicate notifications correctly to avoid processing the same transaction more than once.

2. **Notification Retry Mechanism**  
   If PayBy receives an invalid response or no response (timeout) from the merchant system during backend notification, it will consider the attempt failed and retry the notification.  
   - **Retry Policy**: Up to 7 attempts  
   - **Retry Intervals**: 2, 10, 10, 60, 120, 360, and 900 minutes  

   > **Note:** PayBy does **not guarantee** final delivery success.

3. **Unclear Order Status**  
   If the payment result is not received or the order status is unclear, merchants are advised to actively query the order status using the **transfer query interface**.

4. **Signature Verification**  
   All notification requests are signed using PayBy’s RSA private key.  
   - The signature algorithm is the same as for ordinary requests.  
   - Merchants must verify the signature using PayBy’s public key, which can be downloaded from the merchant portal.


## Notification Parameters

The notification request format is the same as ordinary requests, using the HTTP protocol with HTTP headers and a JSON object in the HTTP body.

## Notification Sample

  "transferBankCardOrder": {
