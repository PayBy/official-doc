# Cash Top Up

This product enables online merchants to accept cash payments from customers who do not have bank accounts. It is especially useful in scenarios such as game account top-ups. In this process, the customer pays cash to a participating store cashier, who then completes the online transaction on their behalf. This solution bridges the gap between cash-based consumers and digital commerce, expanding access to online services.

## User Experience

1.  The customer confirms to add money to his or her online account, the merchant will generate an QR code for the payer's order. Along with the order, Payby will also send a how-to guide to the user's phone.
2.  The customer follows the guide, find a nearest store that running this business.
3.  The payer gives cash (same amount with the order amount) to cashier of the store, the cashier checks the cash then use PayBy POS to scan the QR code. In this process, the store's e-waller balance will be used to pay the payer's order.
4.  The payer will receive notification that the payment has been made, and the balance of the online account added.

## Payment Process

1. **Cash Collection & QR Scan**  
   The cashier verifies the cash amount provided by the payer. Once confirmed, the cashier uses the PayBy POS system to scan the QR code presented by the payer. A password is required to authorize the transaction.

2. **Transaction Execution**  
   Upon scanning, the PayBy backend system deducts the corresponding amount from the store’s PayBy account and updates the online order status to “Success.”

3. **Balance Verification**  
   It is essential for the cashier to ensure that the store’s PayBy account has sufficient balance before initiating the transaction. If the balance is insufficient, the payment cannot be completed.
