# VAM Deposit Notification

## Overview

When a VAM deposit occurs, PayBy sends the relevant deposit information to the merchant via a data stream. The merchant must process the notification and respond according to the specifications outlined in this document.

---

> **Note:**

> 1. **Duplicate Notifications**: The same notification may be sent multiple times. Merchant systems must be able to handle duplicate notifications correctly. 
> 2. **Retry Mechanism**: If PayBy does not receive a valid response or if the response times out, the notification is considered failed and will be retried. The default retry schedule is as follows (in minutes): `2, 10, 10, 60, 120, 360, 900`. However, successful delivery is not guaranteed.
> 3. **Order Status Uncertainty**: If the order status is unclear or the merchant has not received a payment result notification from PayBy, it is recommended to actively query the order status using the designated API.
